First of all, godspeed.

do:
sudo docker run --name manylinux_builder2 -i -t --rm quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_x86_64 bash

with the appropriate vm from here: https://github.com/pypa/manylinux

install rust with:
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

install the development libraries of python:
sudo yum install python-devel
and
sudo yum install python3-devel

then
/opt/python/<each thing>/bin/python setup.py build

if docs fail to build, add python to path randomly or change "python3" in build.rs to something else until it stops doing that

for python3, you might need a little bit of:
RUSTFLAGS='-L /usr/lib64/libpython3.6m.so'
in your life (this was a nightmare to figure out).

If anything else breaks, have fun!
