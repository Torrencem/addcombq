# pf\_addcomb

This is a Sage package (.spkg) for fast Additive Combinatorics functions in Sage.

To install the python library, first make sure you have `cargo` installed. If not, follow the [step-by-step instructions here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) first. Then, run the appropriate installation file for your platform. Right now, only Linux is supported. See ./debug_sage_comp for an example of the temporary way to copy into sage and compile for now.

The next step in development is to figure out building documentation and attaching docstrings to each function at module load time.
