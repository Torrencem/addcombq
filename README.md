# pf\_addcomb

This is a Sage package (.spkg) for fast Additive Combinatorics functions in Sage.

To install the python library, first make sure you have `cargo` installed. If not, follow the [step-by-step instructions here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) first. Then, run the appropriate installation file for your platform. Right now, only Linux is supported. See ./debug_sage_comp for an example of the temporary way to copy into sage and compile for now.

The module `addcomb` at the moment only contains a placeholder function `fib` as a test, but will soon port all of the old Additive Combinatorics functions over.
