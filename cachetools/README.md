## cachetools

Tools for managing the cache.bincode file produced for the addcomb library. Useful for common management operations (merging caches, displaying all cached values)

To run the binary, run `cargo run --release --features="build-binary"`. This will include extra dependencies that aren't in the addcomb library (i.e. clap) that would be wasteful to otherwise include.
