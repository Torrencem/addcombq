The _sigma_ function is defined so that _sigma(G, h)_ is the maximum size of a sidon set_ of _G_. A sidon set is defined precisely in Chapter C of Bela's book.

ARGUMENTS:

* G - Either an integer _n_ (representing G = Z\_n) or a tuple _(n1, n2, ..., nm)_ (representing G = Z\_n1 * Z\_n2 * ... * Z\_nm)

* h - An integer

* (optional) verbose \[default: False\] - Print a sidon set _A_ of size _sigma(G, h)_
