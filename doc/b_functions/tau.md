The _tau_ function is defined so that _tau(G, h)_ is the maximum size of a zero-H-free sumset. In other words, it's the largest size of a set _A_ such that _hA_ does not contain 0.

ARGUMENTS:

* G - Either an integer _n_ (representing G = Z\_n) or a tuple _(n1, n2, ..., nm)_ (representing G = Z\_n1 * Z\_n2 * ... * Z\_nm)

* h - An integer

* (optional) verbose \[default: False\] - Print a zero-H-free sumset set _A_ of maximum size
