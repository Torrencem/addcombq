The tau function is defined so that tau(G, h) is the maximum size of a zero-H-free sumset. In other words, it's the largest size of a set A such that hA does not contain 0.

ARGUMENTS:

* G - Either an integer n (representing G = Z_n) or a tuple (n1, n2, ..., nm) (representing G = Z_n1 * Z_n2 * ... * Z_nm)

* h - An integer

* (optional) verbose [default: False] - Print a zero-H-free sumset set A of maximum size
