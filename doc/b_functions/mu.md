The mu function is defined so that mu(G, k, l) is the maximum size of a set A such that kA is disjoint from lA.

ARGUMENTS:

* G - Either an integer n (representing G = Z_n) or a tuple (n1, n2, ..., nm) (representing G = Z_n1 * Z_n2 * ... * Z_nm)

* k - An integer

* l - An integer

* (optional) verbose [default: False] - Print extra information
