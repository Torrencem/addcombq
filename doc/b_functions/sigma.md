The sigma function is defined so that sigma(G, h) is the maximum size of a sidon set of G. A sidon set is defined precisely in Chapter C of Bela's book.

ARGUMENTS:

* G - Either an integer n (representing G = Z_n) or a tuple (n1, n2, ..., nm) (representing G = Z_n1 * Z_n2 * ... * Z_nm)

* h - An integer

* (optional) verbose [default: False] - Print a sidon set A of size sigma(G, h)
