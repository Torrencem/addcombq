The phi function is defined so that phi(G, h) is the minimum size of a spanning set of G. A spanning set is a set A so that the h fold sumset of A is the entire group G.

ARGUMENTS:

* G - Either an integer n (representing G = Z_n) or a tuple (n1, n2, ..., nm) (representing G = Z_n1 * Z_n2 * ... * Z_nm)

* h - An integer

* (optional) verbose [default: False] - Print a spanning set A of size phi(G, h)
