The rho function is defined so that rho(G, m, h) is the smallest size of hA, where |A| = m. In other words, rho(G, m, h) is the smallest the h-fold sumset of a size m subset of G can be.

ARGUMENTS:

* G - Either an integer n (representing G = Z_n) or a tuple (n1, n2, ..., nm) (representing G = Z_n1 * Z_n2 * ... * Z_nm)

* m - An integer representing the size of the subset A

* h - An integer

* (optional) verbose [default: False] - Print a subset A which minimizes |hA|
